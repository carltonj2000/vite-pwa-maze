Rap 6 is at the bottom of rap 5 and is anchored from a log jammed in the slot and drops about 80 feet and winds through a tight slot and will require some work to squeeze your pack through.

Anchored from tree up on a ledge RDC of where the water course takes a hard left.
Drops 110 feet over a sloped start to a vertical wall with a deep pothole nestled in on the wall. Drops 110 feet over a sloped start to a vertical wall with a couple potholes nestled in the wall.  The second pothole is a swimmer.  The potholes can be avoided by moving to your left as you back down the rappel.  In my opinion you miss one of the more enjoyable raps in this canyon by doing that.

A second option for rap 8 is to turn left and continue down climbing in the water course which is twisty and fun!  Then anchor off a large rock and rap down from just before reaching the hanging pothole.  Reppelling with this option uses only about 40 feet of rope travel.<hr></li><li style="display: auto; font-size: large;"><span style="font-size: 120%"><strong><span style="border-left-style: solid; border-left-width: 4px; border-left-color: #000000; padding-left: 3px;">dIceCubeR9-11</span></strong></span> <strong><span style="font-size: 90%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Rap 22 is anchored from a large boulder and drops 60 feet down a narrow slot as it twists to a narrow pool below.  Be careful how you set the anchor to avoid sticking the rope in a couple cracks.  Extending the anchor is awkward but a good idea.

Rap 23 is the final rap.  It is anchored from a single bolt and hanger and 2 wedge devices in a crack. This is the only rap in the canyon that is not from a natural anchor.  Drops 190' down a vertical wall that is sometimes a water fall.  A Mea West set up is recommended since the start of this rap is in a very narrow crack.  It makes it easier to get you and your pack through and helps take the weight off of your harness while on the long rap.<hr></li><li style="display: auto; font-size: large;"><span style="font-size: 120%"><strong><span style="">yIceCubeLowrBt</span></strong></span> <strong><span style="font-size: 90%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

	<h3 class="section-header">General Comments</h3>


		<p class="p_general-indent">		
			<strong>Note / Warning:</strong><br>Over the past few years bolts 
			have been being placed in Ice Cube Canyon.&nbsp; Those bolts are 
			un-welcomed by many in the community who wish to keep Ice Cube in 
			the bolt free status it has enjoyed for decades.&nbsp; June 2017 a 
			group of us have removed the bolts in Ice Cube Canyon and it is once 
			again bolt free.&nbsp; Bolts may be placed by others at some future 
			date.&nbsp; When enjoying Ice Cube Canyon be prepared to use natural 
			anchors and use some technical know how when using or creating new 
			natural anchors.</p>
		<p class="p_general">		
			It is nice to know there is a canyon of this level right here at 
			home.&nbsp; There are lots of rappels and a lot of great views.&nbsp; A couple 
			of the raps are very interesting.&nbsp; Depending on water flow at the 
			time you go through Ice Cube, you might get the chance to do the 
			final rappel while getting pummeled with water from the water fall.&nbsp; 
			There are very few canyon routes in Red Rock.&nbsp; This route is the 
			only one that is right up there with the good stuff in Zion.		
		</p>
	<p class="p_general">		
			If you are lucky enough to do this canyon shortly after some heavy 
			rains, as we did in August of 2007, you will be greeted with a 
			flowing water fall for the last rappel.&nbsp; Rap 23 takes on it's own 
			charm when water is flowing and you are pummeled with water as you 
			rap along the water fall.		
		</p>
	<p class="p_general">		
			Some do this route by dropping a vehicle at the Icebox Canyon 
			trailhead then taking a 4 wheel drive vehicle down Rocky Gap Road to 
			where the route leaves the road.&nbsp; After the route is completed and 
			the party ends up at the Icebox Canyon trailhead they must recover 
			the vehicle on Rocky Gap Road.&nbsp; This can take a lot of time since 
			the Red Rock loop is a 13 mile one way loop.&nbsp; It is much simpler to 
			leave your only vehicle at the Willow Springs picnic area and make 
			the route a loop.&nbsp; Doing this as a loop hike simplifies things a 
			lot!&nbsp; <strong>Note: </strong>on our trip 2019-07-07 the road 
			was significantly worse than I had seen it in the past.&nbsp; High 
			clearance, 4x4 definitely recommended if driving the road.</p>
		<p class="p_general">		
			Some of the raps listed here can be bypassed like rap 17 and rap 21.&nbsp; Your 
			actual rap count may vary depending on how you navigate certain 
			sections.&nbsp; Raps 1, 9, 10, 17, 18 and 21 can be down climbed 
			depending on your downclimbing comfort level.&nbsp; 
			On future visits rap 12 seems to be unused.</p>
		<p class="p_general">		
			<strong>Overnight Permit</strong>:<br>
			The Red Rock Loop closes near sunset and a ranger sweeps the area 
			for cars to be sure everyone is out.&nbsp; The time the loop opens 
			and closes varies with time of year but is near sunrise and sunset.&nbsp; 
			If you feel your group may take a long time with the route, you 
			should try to get an overnight permit for Red Rock ahead of time.&nbsp; 
			If you come off the route after the loop has closed and do not have 
			a permit you could be ticketed or fined.&nbsp; For information on 
			obtaining a permit contact the Red Rock Visitor Center at (702) 
			515-5350.</p>
	<p class="p_general-indent">		
			<strong>Note about the alternate Sneak Route:<br>
			</strong>There is an alternate route for this canyon that will shave 
			off some time and miles.&nbsp; The down side is you do not get to 
			see the upper technical section and you&nbsp; miss most of the 
			middle non-technical section.&nbsp; I personally enjoy the upper 
			section of the canyon.&nbsp; With that in mind I prefer the full 
			route.&nbsp; Try both out and see what you think.&nbsp; See the Ice 
			Cube Canyon Sneak Route Page for a route description.</p>

		portion of the canyon on that route, scroll down to the 
		section just after rap 12.</p>	
		
		<p class="p_general">
			<strong>The Approach:</strong><br>
			From the Willow Springs parking area / trailhead (tWillowSpring) 
			walk 2.4 miles on Rocky Gap Road to the start of an alternate route 
			to Bridge Mountain.&nbsp; At this point a wash crosses the road coming in 
			from the right (west) side of the road.&nbsp; A few feet before this 
			wash, will be a faint trail leaving the road to the east 
			(tAlt2Brdg2).&nbsp; The trail is sometimes marked by a cairn and is 
			where your route leaves the road.</p>
	<p class="p_general">
			The trail leaving the road leads to a wash running parallel with the 
			road and crosses the wash.&nbsp; Just after crossing the wash the trail 
			becomes wide and starts to follow what looks like the remnants of an 
			old dirt road.&nbsp; You will not follow this wide path very far.&nbsp; Just 
			over 250 feet from leaving Rocky Gap Road, the trail leaves the wide 
			path and turns left to start up the ridge line (wAlt2BrdgRP-01).</p>
	<p class="p_general">
			Follow the use trail up the ridge.&nbsp; The path is easy to follow but is far from being a 
			standard trail.&nbsp; On the way up, there is one well traveled path 
			and a few not so well traveled paths and they all tend to go to the 
			same place.&nbsp; Just follow up the ridge heading south then gradually 
			turning south east.&nbsp; Before reaching the top of the ridge the path 
			starts across wide open, but steep sand stone.&nbsp; Follow the cairns 
			that lead to a saddle at the top of the ridge (wAlt2BrdgRP-02).&nbsp; It 
			should take about an hour to travel From Rocky Gap Road to the top 
			of the ridge if you keep moving.&nbsp; The elevation gain on this section 
			is a little over 1500 feet in about one mile so it is steep.&nbsp; Plan 
			on a slow but continuous pace.&nbsp; On the south side of this pass at 
			the top of the climb are good views of 
			Bridge Mountain to the southeast.</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			From the saddle (wAlt2BrdgRP-02) look south west across the head of 
			Ice Box Canyon.&nbsp; Follow around the top of the Ice Box Canyon 
			just below the tree line.&nbsp; The top of Ice Box canyon forks into 
			what looks like two separate bowl shaped heads.&nbsp; The tree line is very obvious and 
			the route around both bowls at the head of Ice Box is also obvious if you aim for 
			just below the tree line.&nbsp; A ridge dividing Ice Box and Ice 
			cube is about 0.5 miles from the saddle.</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			After walking around both bowl shaped tops of Ice Box Canyon, you will find yourself on a ridge that runs between 
			Ice Box and Ice Cube Canyons. From this ridge it is about another 1500 feet 
			to the top entry of Ice Cube Canyon (yIceCubeUperTp). The dirt and 
			rock here is now a bit purple. Look slightly west of south, for a 
			band of yellow rock mixed in with the purple. This is where Ice Cube 
			Canyon comes in from the east. The entry point to Ice Cube is about 4.2 miles from 
			the trailhead.</p>
		
		
		
		<p class="p_general">
			<strong>The Canyon / Technical Section:</strong> <br>
			From the head of the canyon (yIceCubeUperTp) walk down canyon LDC.&nbsp; A short distance after entering the canyon 
			will be a series of pot holes then some trees below with a 
			large downed tree next to the other trees. Just beyond the trees is 
			the first rappel. To get to the first rappel, do not travel along 
			the canyon floor.&nbsp; Instead stay a bit high LDC to bypass a 
			drop.&nbsp; After getting past the drop you will be able to drop 
			down the side of the canyon to the floor near the group of trees.</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			Rap 1 (dIceCubeR1) is about 370 feet down canyon of the drop in 
			point and 100 feet beyond a large dead tree.&nbsp; Rap 1 is anchored 
			from a stone horn and drops about 15 feet over a large grey 
			rock and has an overhang portion.&nbsp; Rap 1 can be down climbed by 
			those with moderate down climbing skills.&nbsp; The first 6 feet is 
			down to a ledge under a boulder.&nbsp; The second half is down an 
			almost vertical section of slick rock about 8 feet with a few foot 
			holds on the way down.</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			About 100 feet after rap 1 is a deceiving down climb. It drops about 
			8 feet and looks like you need to rap or hand line down but is 
			easy enough for most with no assistance.&nbsp; There are lots of 
			hidden foot and hand holds you canâ€™t easily see from the top. Just 
			above this DC is a cairn that houses a plastic jar and a log book 
			for those interested in signing it.</p>
		<p class="p_general">
						Following the canyon floor beyond rap 1will 
			soon lead to a drop off RDC of a large boulder sitting 
			in the canyon floor. Walk LDC around the boulder into the trees to 
			get to the top of rap 2.</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			Rap 2 (dIceCubeR2-4) is anchored from the base of one of 
			these small trees and drops about 30 feet down a slope.
		</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			Rap 3 is only about 50 feet down canyon from rap 2. Rap 3 is 
			anchored from a large tree RDC and drops about 35 feet down to some 
			pot holes then into a narrow slot. In this narrow slot is another 
			drop of about 45 feet to a landing and pool below.&nbsp; Total drop 
			is about 80 feet.</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			The tree used for the anchor of rap 3 juts out almost 
			horizontally from the wall on the right then quickly begins to go 
			vertical. This tree is huge but dead. It seemed solid enough at the 
			moment. As a general rule it is not safe to rap from a dead 
			tree because you can never be sure about the integrity of the root 
			system. There is another large tree nearby that should be used 
			instead. Next time I make it to this canyon I will most likely re 
			rig the rap from the other tree, if it has not already been done.</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			At the bottom of rap 3 is a small pool with another drop just below it. 
			This is where rap 4 starts.</p>
		<p class="p_general">
						Rap 4 uses an interesting anchor. 
			There are no choke stones, large stones to build a cairn anchor or 
			dead man with, no trees and no bolted hangers. Just overhead RDC is 
			a large sandstone rock flake that separates from the walls of the 
			slot. To anchor from here tie a large knot in the end of a loop of 
			webbing, slip the webbing between the rock flake and the wall, then 
			pull on the loop until the knot wedges above the rock. Anchor to the 
			webbing and rappel.</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			Rap 4 drops about 30 feet with the first half being slightly sloped 
			and possibly down climbed. The second half is an almost vertical 
			drop. You should be careful not to shock the anchor here with sudden 
			loads. Keep steady tension on the anchor and try to keep it minimal.</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			It would be a good idea to look over the anchor for rap 4 before 
			pulling the ropes for rap 3.&nbsp; If any thing were to happen to 
			the anchor for rap 4 there would be few options available.&nbsp; If 
			the anchor is damaged and cannot be used, the ropes still attached 
			to the anchors for rap 3 may prove useful.</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			Rap 5 (dIceCubeR5-7) is about 100 feet after rap 4.&nbsp; Rap 5 is anchored from another 
			small tree and drops about 60 feet. Rap 5 drops down to another slot 
			with a pool at the bottom.</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			Rap 6 is directly at the bottom of rap 5. Rap 6 is anchored from a 
			log jammed in the slot and drops about 80 feet as it winds through a 
			tight slot. A short distance down, the slot levels out for a very 
			short distance before dropping again. In this slightly level portion 
			the slot gets tight before dropping again. You may have to work a 
			bit to push your pack through and you definitely will not be able to 
			turn sideways. Backing into and pushing your way through until you 
			start dropping again seemed to be the best approach.</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			Because rap 6 drops then twists through a tight slot before dropping 
			again a lot of rope drag is created. We found rap 6 to be difficult 
			to pull. FYI.
		</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			Rap 7 is directly below rap 6 and is anchored from a small choke stone in 
			the canyon floor. Rap 7 drops about 40 feet down a slope into and 
			through a few pot holes.</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			After rap 7 down climb along the canyon floor for about 50 feet to a 
			pothole where the water course takes a sharp left. When the water 
			course takes a sharp left you are close to rap 8 and have two 
			options.&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="p_general-indent">
			<strong>Option 1 for rap 8:</strong><br>
			The first choice is to not follow the water course.  
			Instead of following the water course left, climb out the other side 
			of the pot hole straight ahead and up to the ledge RDC above.</p>
		<p class="p_general-indent">
			Rap 8 (dIceCubeR8) is from the ledge 
			up out of the water course.&nbsp; Rap 8 is anchored from a small 
			tree.&nbsp; There used to be a piton here as well but it was removed 
			sometime between June 2008 and Aug 2010.&nbsp; Rap 8 drops about 110 feet 
			and starts down a gentle slope and soon goes vertical down the side 
			of the canyon wall. About half way down the vertical wall you meet 
			up with the water course you didnâ€™t follow just before rap 8. The 
			rap drops you into a pot hole which you climb out of, then rap down 
			to another pothole. The second pothole is a swimmer. Climbing out of 
			this second pothole leaves you on more vertical wall and the rap 
			drops to the canyon floor in another small pothole. From the bottom 
			looking up, it appears there is a pothole sitting on the side of the 
			canyon wall that you drop into along the rappel. In reality the 
			rappel bypasses then rejoins the water course. While I find the 
			layout of this option fun I like option two for rap 8 better (see 
			below).</p>
		<p class="p_general-indent">
			If you would like to avoid the potholes on the way down rap 8 you 
			can stay to your left (down canyon) as you start rap 8. This will 
			give you a long vertical rap that drops to the bottom with no 
			potholes in the way. In my opinion you miss a very fun rap that way.</p>
		<p class="p_general-indent">
			<strong>Option 2 for rap 8:</strong><br>
			The second option for Rap 8 is to turn left in the pothole and stay in the water course.&nbsp; 
			Down 
			climb and stem down about 30 feet.&nbsp; This slot is very pretty 
			with twisted walls.&nbsp; Walk across a muddy pool then down 
			climb another 20 feet down a twisted section that can be slid down 
			feeling like you are in a water park.&nbsp; The pot hole 
			at the bottom of the twisty slide has a large rock that can be used 
			as an anchor.&nbsp; Rapping from this rock drops you about 15 feet 
			down into what looks like the hanging pothole on the other 
			variation.&nbsp; Rappelling with this option uses only about 40 feet 
			of rope travel.&nbsp; Also of note, a portion of the wall of the 
			twisted flute you just slid down has broken off.&nbsp; This is the 
			rock you will anchor to as the anchor.</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			Rap 9 (dIceCubeR9-11) is about 200 feet down canyon of rap 8.&nbsp; 
			Rap 9 is anchored from a choke stone and drops about 40 feet to a 
			pool.&nbsp; Rap 9 is actually a pretty easy down climb.&nbsp; It 
			looks deceivingly difficult from the top but is not difficult.</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			Rap 10 is just beyond the pool below rap 9.&nbsp; Rap 10 is 
			anchored from another choke stone and drops about 15 feet to a 
			swimmer pothole below. On the other side of the pothole is an easy 
			slide and down climb to the canyon floor.&nbsp; Rap 10 is an easy 
			down climb along a crack to the pool below.</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			Rap 11 is shortly after rap 10. Rap 11 is anchored from a choke stone and 
			drops about 10 feet to a large pool at the bottom. After swimming 
			across the pool the rap continues down another 30 feet to anther 
			pool below. The second pool is a swimmer.</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			Just after rap 11 it appears the best route is to bypass a bunch of 
			boulders and go LDC.&nbsp; Instead down climb through the boulders 
			and start looking for a dirt path leading up out of the wash RDC.&nbsp; 
			This path will follow along the RDC wall about 50 feet up out of the 
			canyon and bypass a lot of boulder hopping for about 250 feet.</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			After rap 11 the canyon opens up a little and travel turns into lots 
			of boulder hopping. Soon there is a large drop that can be climbed 
			around LDC. Some portions of the climb around are steep with some 
			exposure. It can be made a bit easier and safer by staying higher 
			where there is a bit more level ground.</p>
			<p class="p_general">
			About 350 feet down canyon of rap 11 is a major drop that is down climbable with some 
			effort. A better option is to climb up LDC then over to rap 12.&nbsp; 
			I have not found this rap needed on future visits to the canyon and 
			is easily bypassed without knowing it.</p>
		<p class="p_general">
						Rap 
			12 (dIceCubeR12) is anchored from a small pine tree and drops about 25 feet. You 
			cannot see the pine tree when you start to climb around. This is 
			like a climb around rap combination. From the bottom of rap 12 walk 
			down the slope to the canyon floor.</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			After rap 12 starts the non-technical middle portion of the route.&nbsp; The canyon stays wide open and travel is straight down the canyon 
			floor. There is no trail and the route has lots of boulder hopping and 
			a small amounts of bush whacking.</p>
		<p class="p_general-indent">
			About 0.6 miles down canyon of rap 12 is where the <strong>Sneak Route</strong> will 
 will 
			drop into the canyon (jIceCubeSneak).&nbsp; If using this beta for 
			canyon information via the Sneak Route, this is where your canyon 
			section will start.</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			About 0.7 miles down canyon is a 30 foot drop that can be bypassed 
			LDC.&nbsp; This drop is marked as the top of the lower technical 
			section (yIceCubeLowrTp).&nbsp; This 30 foot drop is about 550 feet 
			down canyon of where the Sneak Route drops into the canyon.</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			Rap 13 is where the canyon starts to close in again and is about 0.9 
			miles down canyon of rap 12.&nbsp;
			Rap 13 (dIceCubeR13) is anchored from a small tree and drops 60 feet to a pool 
			below. 			</p><p class="p_general">
						Below rap 13 the canyon is wide but has steep high walls. Along the walk below rap 13 is a huge boulder wedged 
			overhead between the walls of the canyon for your viewing pleasure.
		</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			Rap 14 (dIceCubeR14) is about 500 feet after rap 13 and is anchored from 2 small boulders.&nbsp; 
			Rap 14 drops 
			about 100 feet to a large pool below. Rap 14 drops along a flat 
			sheer wall for most of the way with a couple small ledges near the 
			bottom. The pool is a swimmer if you go from the rope straight down 
			canyon. However if you stay far LDC, the water is only a little over knee deep. 
		</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			There was a film of green algae like stuff on the water at the pool 
			below rap 14.&nbsp; It gave a very nice scenic look to the area 
			below rap 14. This rap is scenic just because of the large closed in 
			area you are rapping into and the height of it along a sheer flat 
			wall to a large pool below.</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			Rap 15 (dIceCubeR15-17) is about 400 feet after rap 14.&nbsp; Rap 15 is anchored from a pile of 
			rocks and drops about 20 feet to the wide slot below. Rap has a 
			deep over hang and can be a bit awkward. 
		</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			From the bottom of rap 15, 
			travel down the ledge on the right, to a long pool. On the other 
			side of that pool is the top of rap 16.
		</p> 		
			
			<p class="p_general">
			Rap 16 is anchored LDC high on the wall. There is a long strap of 
			webbing extending down to the pool and across the other side where 
			the rap leaves the pool RDC. Rap 16 drops from the pool about 15 feet to 
			another pool.
		</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			Rap 17 is just beyond the pool at the bottom of rap 16. Rap 17 is anchored 
			from the base of a medium size tree about 20 feet up canyon from the 
			top of the rap and drops about 12 feet to yet another pool.&nbsp; 
			Rap 17 can be easily bypassed by walking around a ledge RDC.&nbsp; 
			This rap is not needed but remains as part of the beta to keep from 
			re labeling the rappels.</p>
		<p class="p_general">
						Rap 18 is a few hundred feet after rap 17.&nbsp; Rap 18 has 2 options for an 
			anchor. One is the large choke stone you stand on to start the rap. 
			This makes the rappel very precarious to initiate. Since the anchor 
			is the rock you are standing on you have no support from the rope 
			until you have stemmed your way down under the rock you were 
			standing on. The rock is only about 2 feet thick and there is a 
			sever overhang under the rock. After using this anchor once, it 
						becomes apparent there needs to be a safer option.&nbsp; The other 
			option is from a tree just up canyon from the rock.&nbsp; The small 
						tree just up canyon of the drop is by far the safer 
						choice.</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			Rap 18 (dIceCubeR18) drops 15 feet to an ankle deep pool at the bottom.&nbsp; 
			Rap 18 can also be down climbed by people around 6 foot tall.&nbsp; 
			To down climb stem down RDC of a boulder.&nbsp; As you get near the 
			bottom of the boulder extend your legs out to the other side of the 
			slot and stem down.&nbsp; Shorter people will have difficulty with 
			this and should have a belay or just rappel here.</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			Rap 19 (dIceCubeR19-20) is about 300 feet down canyon of rap 18.&nbsp; 
			Rap 19 is anchored LDC from a small tree. Webbing is 
			stretched across a small pool to the rap RDC. Rap 19 drops about 12 
			feet to a pool below. The pool is a swimmer for a few feet at the 
			bottom then gets shallower so you can walk. The pool winds 
			through a short narrow section to another drop of about 5 feet. This 
			drop is sloped and easy to slide down to the next pool that is a 
			little over knee deep.
		</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			Rap 20 is a short walk after the pools below rap 19.&nbsp; Rap 20 is anchored from a 
			small tree and drops down a rock pile about 15 feet to a narrow 
			section.&nbsp; Rap 20 is an pretty easy down climb for most people 
			and should be labeled as a down climb not a rappel.</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			Just beyond rap 20 is a long narrow swim. To get to this swim you 
			need to stem your way down between the walls of the canyon to the 
			water below. This narrow swim section is about 100 feet long with a 
			rock in the middle to climb over. Over head is a large boulder 
			wedged between the walls of the canyon. This section is a very fun 
			place if you arenâ€™t too cold to enjoy it.</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			After a short walk past the narrow swim is a down climb in another narrow section 
			to a pool below. After exiting the pool is another short walk to rap 
			21.
		</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			Rap 21 (dIceCubeR21) is anchored from a small tree RDC and is another favorite rap on 
			the route. This rap is within a huge rock fall in the canyon. The 
			rap goes below a boulder the size of a house and drops about 30 feet 
			to a large pool below it. The narrow canyon walls form the sides and 
			the large boulder forms the roof. The pool below, almost feels like 
			you are in a large natural indoor swimming pool. This would make a 
			great swimming hole in the heat of the summer if it were easier to get 
			to. The pool below the boulder is a swimmer for a few feet before it 
			starts to get shallower and you can start walking down canyon in the 
			water still under the boulder.</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			Rap 21 can be down climbed if you stay RDC before getting to the rap 
			and work down a series of ledges.</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			After the large pool and boulder the canyon opens slightly with easy 
			travel.</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			Rap 22 (dIceCubeR22-23) is about 300 feet after rap 21.&nbsp; From the top of 
			Rap 22 you can see out of the canyon to the Red Rock Scenic Loop. 
			It is in very sharp contrast to what you have been seeing most of 
			the day.&nbsp;
			Rap 22 is anchored from a large boulder and drops about 60 feet to a 
			narrow section with knee deep water in it. About 40 feet at the 
			other end of this knee deep pool is the top of rap 23 the final rap.</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			Be careful with the placement or the anchor for rap 22.&nbsp; If the 
			webbing is not strung long enough the rope runs over a boulder with 
			pinch points on either side.&nbsp; When the rope gets weighted it 
			will pull into one of the pinch points and you may need to ascend 
			back up the rope to go get it unstuck.&nbsp; Ask me how I know this.&nbsp; 
			Be sure to extend the webbing beyond these pinch points.&nbsp; This 
			WILL make the start of the rap more awkward but will ensure you can 
			pull your ropes when you get to the bottom.</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			At the bottom of rap 22 is a 40 foot long narrow pool (only knee 
			deep).&nbsp; The pool is in very narrow section and at the other end 
			is the top of rap 23.&nbsp; Looking out from the top of rap 23 feels 
			like looking out a large keyhole high above the desert below.</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			Rap 23 is 190 
			feet and is anchored from one bolt and hanger and 2 wedge style 
			anchors. It appears the anchor point used to be from a small choke 
			stone at your feet as you begin the rap. Since this is no longer the 
			case, rap 23 is the only rap that is not anchored from a natural 
			anchor in this canyon. The view from the top of this rap is great. 
			You can look over the Red Rock Scenic Loop in the bright sun while 
			you are perched high above in a wet shaded crack in the canyon.</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			For this rap use both of the 200â€™ ropes tied together. When setting 
			up the ropes for this rap it is help full to offset the knot from 
			the top so it is well over the edge from the top of the rap to help keep the rope from getting stuck 
			in the cracks at the top of the rap.
			The start of Rap 23 is very narrow and requires some work to get 
			your pack through the opening and begin starting down. 
		</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			The bottom of rap 23 has a large pool at the bottom. There is ample 
			sitting room on the other side for a break and clean up of gear.</p>
		
		
		
		<p class="p_general">
			<strong>The Exit: </strong><br>
			From the bottom of rap 23 is a lot of boulder hopping to get to the 
			wash below. There is no one good route through this section. Be 
			prepared to move slowly for about 600 feet as you work your way 
			toward the main wash at the bottom (yIceCubeLowrBt).
		</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			Once in the main wash (yIceCubeLowrBt), travel down wash and look 
			for a path LDC to cut through the dense vegetation up to the trails on 
			the banks above. From there it is about 0.5 miles following a web of 
			very well used trails to the Ice Box Canyon Trailhead (tIceBoxCyn).</p>
		<p class="p_general">
			From the Ice Box Canyon Trailhead travel north west along the road about 1.2 miles to the Willow Springs Parking 
			area where you left your cars (tWillowSpring).</p>
